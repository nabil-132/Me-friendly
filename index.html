            Milfy City, an adult visual novel game that has generated controversy and anticipation over the years, has finally released its final 1.0 version. The controversy and outrage surrounding Milfy City stemmed from the game's constant delays over a period of several years. Fans and supporters were eagerly anticipating the release, but the repeated delays led to frustration and skepticism. Many questioned the developers ability to deliver a finished product, and the constant delays damaged the game's reputation and generated a ton of negative publicity.


            Despite the controversies and delays <b>Milfy City</b> gained a significant following and became popular among players. The game's characters, such as Linda, Caroline, and Sara, have become legendary, with a large fan base and a plethora of fan art dedicated to each of them.

            But is Milfy City actually good? Let's dive in.
             <hr>
            <b>MILFY CITY - THE STORY</b>

            Milfy City is an adult visual novel game that was first released in 2018. In this game, players assume the role of a young protagonist who lives with his attractive "landlady" and two young and sexy "roommates." The main objective is to progress through different storylines and unlock lewd scenes.

<i> "The relationship switch from family members to the now-industry standard "landlady" and "step-rooomates" happened due to the enforcement of Patreon rules."</i>

After the protagonist's failed attempt at asking one of his teachers out on a date, he finds himself at the center of public humiliation and embarrassment. As a result, the school recommends that he seek therapy with the school counselor, who, coincidentally, as we learn later, also provides counseling services to the protagonist's "landlady". The reason your mom, I mean landlady (Linda), visits the therapist becomes evident fairly quickly, and as you might guess, reason involves the MC. The MC is then set on a path of revenge and sex.

The game features a variety of events and story paths that players need to complete in order to progress. For instance, your older "roommate" Caroline, has a clothing store where she sells sexy cosplay sets and needs your help with modeling and whatnot. The younger "roommate," Sara, has trouble with school as she is gaming all the time and so on.

<i>The approach to the story of Milfy City was still fresh when the game first came out in 2018, but now, five years later, we have seen it at least 100 times.</i>

<img  class="image-4" src="https://media.spicygaming.net/fit-in/576x324/filters:no_upscale()/media/games/media_galleries/screenshot0027_wMsprZJ_YoHBDGC.webp" alt="Spice">


The storylines are far from complex, and they serve merely as a placeholder for the spicy scenes, which are the main focus of the game. But what Milfy City and Icstor have accomplished, and what he has always excelled at, are the characters. The magic in how you, as the player, connect with them continues to fascinate me.


As of 1.0, most of the storylines seem to be complete, but they leave a bitter taste. Stories were rushed, some of them without a proper ending. Icstor announced he would expand on them with the upcoming DLCs.

More waiting?

<b>MILFY CITY - THE GAMEPLAY</b>

Milfy City is played as a <b>visual novel game</b>, where players make choices through text to progress the story. The game also features an open-world <b>sandbox</b> system, allowing players to freely explore different locations and interact with characters. This gives the game a feeling of non-linearity.

<i>Now, in 2024, Milfy City does not feel like it's leading the pack but is just becoming one of the many, at least in the gameplay department.</i>

The hype was there for a reason, and not all of it was because of the graphical excellence, which I will cover later.

<img class="image-5" src="https://media.spicygaming.net/fit-in/576x324/filters:no_upscale()/media/games/media_galleries/screenshot0004_KSxAGED_o2q3BZO.webp">


Milfy City features gameplay mechanics that were considered advanced when the game was first released in 2018. The introduction of the sandbox type of gameplay, allowing players to freely explore different locations and interact with characters, was innovative at the time. However, as the game stopped receiving regular updates, the quality started to decrease, leading to inconsistencies and bugs in the final 1.0 version. For instance, the approach to free roam changes throughout the game. Some of the mini-games have no real value and are placed there only to prolong the gameplay time. As with the the story, execution feels rushed, and many of the elements are buggy, to say the least.
<br>

<b>MILFY CITY - VISUALS AND SOUND</b>
<br>

Now this is the part where I can actually still get quite excited. It is remarkable, but even after 5 years since Milfy City first launched, the renders in Milfy City are still widely regarded as some of the best in the 3D Adult Visual Novel (AVN) sector. One reason for this is the incredible attention to detail that is evident in each render. From the characters' facial expressions to their posture and overall appearance, every element is meticulously crafted to convey a sense of realism and depth. Additionally, the use of lighting and shading is exceptional, creating a lifelike quality to the renders. The post-production work on each render is done to perfection.

<img class="image-6" src="https://media.spicygaming.net/fit-in/576x324/filters:no_upscale()/media/games/media_galleries/screenshot0022_WUHoEWJ_FnlfbLr.webp">

The character models are outstanding. Girls (especially the main three) are sexy, diverse, and have charisma. It is rare that you can actually feel the characters just through their facial expressions, posture, and overall appearance. You can clearly see the (maybe even unhealthy) lust in Linda with her sultry gaze and provocative clothing choices. Sara, on the other hand, embodies innocence and playfulness with her wide green eyes and youthful appearance. Lastly, Caroline's protective relationship with the MC is evident in her facial expressions and body language, conveying her devotion and care. These details not only make the characters visually appealing but also help to establish their individual personalities and the dynamics between them and the MC.

<img class="image-7" src="https://media.spicygaming.net/fit-in/576x324/filters:no_upscale()/media/games/media_galleries/screenshot0018_hpmuEGF_M9GPjmB.webp">

When it comes to animations, Milfy City was one of the best in that aspect five years ago. Certainly, the animations were one of the most important factors that contributed to the popularity of Milfy City, and they play a crucial role in the game's overall appeal. Animations are smooth, diverse, and of high quality. Even though they are usually short and in a loop format, there are plenty of them.

In regards to the music, voice and SFX, game features some basic elements. The background music is OK, the SFX are there to enhance the gameplay. There is no voice acting present in the game. Overall nothing spectacular.

<b>MILFY CITY - THE SEX</b>

Now about the spicy. As you might expect, <b>a game with the title Milfy City</b> will not hold back on its lewd elements. As is expected, Milfy City uses a <b>slow-build</b> approach, which is typical for AVN games. The majority of girls take the same route. First there is some cuddling and kissing, followed by giving different "jobs" (BJ, FJ, and TJ) and ultimately sex. In that sense, the development is quite linear, and the next scene is readily apparent. In addition to the main events, you also unlock some optional scenes. For instance, you can have some sexy fun by visiting the girls at night or inviting them to join you in the evening in your room. Although optional, this game element increases the variety and quantity of sex scenes.

<img class="image-8" src="https://media.spicygaming.net/fit-in/576x324/filters:no_upscale()/media/games/media_galleries/screenshot0002_TPwKzn8_fM2GIkp.webp">

Overall, the sex scenes are hot and varied, and the girls add their personalities to the scenes as well. Even though there are <b>BDSM</b> elements present in Mifly City, most of the game is pretty vanilla when it comes to sex. So vanilla in fact that even, the number of threesomes is underwhelming, if you ask me.

What Milfy City excels at, though, is the eroticism throughout the scenes and the whole game.

The game utilizes various visual and narrative techniques to create a sense of eroticism, such as strategically positioning characters, utilizing suggestive dialogue, and designing scenes that evoke a very spicy atmosphere. One thing is for sure: Caroline will possess you with her <b>bubble butt</b>, and you will not be able to do anything about it.

<b>CONCLUSION</b>

In conclusion, Milfy City is an adult visual novel game with a controversial reputation due to constant delays. While the storylines in the game can feel rushed and lacking closure, the characters are a standout feature, with their depth and sex appeal. The gameplay, although innovative at the time of its first release, now feels inconsistent and buggy. However, the visuals and animations remain impressive. The game's lewd elements are varied and spicy, creating an erotic atmosphere. 


Overall, Milfy Citys appeal may vary depending on individual preferences. For a deep story, keep looking, but for a game with iconic characters, play it and you might experience the hype.
