    <big><b>Tips:</b></big>

    – If you want to use an item you have to first select it in the inventory and then use it on the desired object.

    – The map is usually active when you are outside or when you’re at the beginning of each location.
    
    – If you’re stuck during the story, try to talk with the desired person a few times at different times of the day.
    
    – The time skip button only works while you’re on the map screen.
    
    – Not enough money? Try the minigames on the PC
    
    – To spy on someone in the bathroom you need to buy “Spy Camera” in the shop. Then use it on the bathroom door.
